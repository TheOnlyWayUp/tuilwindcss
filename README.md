# tuilwindcss

Inspired by [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), this project offers a utility first set of classes that can be used directly to construct TUI apps with Textual. It's an experimental project to see if it makes it easier to construct apps. 

There are two files generated by this project: `style.css` and `style.min.css`.
