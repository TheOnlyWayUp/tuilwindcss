# tuilwindcss

This project is inspired by [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) to offers a similar set of classes that can be used directly to construct TUI apps with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). It's an experimental project to see if it makes it easier to construct apps. 

> Please check out tailwind.css if you haven't already. This project is not affiliated or endorsed by tailwind labs, but it's an awesome project.

## Contents 

There are two files generated by this project: `style.css` and `style.min.css`. These contain the relevant classes that mimic the names that tailwind uses.
