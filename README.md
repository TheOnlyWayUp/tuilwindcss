# tuilwindcss

Inspired by [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), this project offers a utility first set of classes that can be used directly to construct TUI apps with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). It's an experimental project to see if it makes it easier to construct apps. 

There are two files generated by this project: `style.css` and `style.min.css`. These contain the relevant classes that mimic the names that tailwind uses.

## Supported Classes

This library supports: 

- `bg-<color>-<intencity>`
